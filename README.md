This Repo contains the projects related to Parallel programming in CUDA.

○ Parallel Simulation of Tank Warfare Game : Developed a parallel computing simulation to model tank warfare, calculating real-time interactions such as HP update and Score update on a grid-based battlefield. Implemented algorithms to compute and return the final scores of each tank based on game rules, enhancing computational efficiency.

○ Moving Scene Graphs : Implemented parallelized BFS in CUDA to efficiently perform translations on 2D images. scene graphs using dynamic memory management.

The repo contains the .CU files for both the projects.
